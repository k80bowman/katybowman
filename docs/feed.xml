        <title>Morning Pages</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was a tough week for creative work. I had family coming in from out of town and I hosted dinner for 18 on Friday, which means my creative work really was just cooking. Which is fun for me. Especially since I was trying out a couple of new recipes this year (and they were successful!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was funny, though, I woke up Monday morning last week with a desire to do Morning Pages. For those of you who have never encountered Julia Cameron’s The Artist’s Way, Morning Pages are three stream-of-consciousness, long-hand pages you’re supposed to write every morning, first thing. They’re meant to get your brain going so you can focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to do them every morning. I would get up early, sit down, and just write. I was strict about it, too, following Cameron’s instructions to use regular-sized paper and write first thing, before I did anything else (well, anything besides get myself a cup of tea first). And I found, after a while, that on days when I didn’t do them, my brain didn’t feel as good. It wasn’t as clear and sometimes, if I didn’t do them for a few days, I would start feeling a bit down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, however, eventually I became interested in doing other things with that time and I stopped doing them. Until Monday, I hadn’t thought about doing Morning Pages in a couple of years. But I got up Monday morning and I sat down and I wrote three pages long-hand and it felt so good! I’ve been doing them every day ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days are easier than others. Like this morning, I didn’t get three pages in. But even writing two pages is something.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Elizabeth Gilbert's Magic Lessons Podcast</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just spent pretty much all day listening to Elizabeth Gilbert’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/magic-lessons/&quot;&gt;Magic Lessons podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend checking it out. Especially episode 12 where she talks with Brene Brown. I listened to that one twice. Although I learned a lot from all of them. It was interesting hearing from the different women about where they are with their creativity and what was blocking them from doing the work that they felt they needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guests she talks with are amazing, too, and each one provides a different perspective on life and how to incorporate creativity. Cheryl Strayed talked about creativity and motherhood and how one of the most important things you can model for your kids is pursuing your passions “like a motherfucker.” Rob Bell talked about being present in everything you do and realizing that life is what is happening right now and that you need to pay attention and find the wonder in even the most boring places. Ann Patchett talked about just diving in and doing the hard work you need to do. Rayya Elias talked about making things for yourself, just for the joy of making things. John Hodgeman talked about being free to change directions and take your creativity to new places. And Brene Brown, of course, talked about how to counteract the shame and fear that keep us from being our most creative selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will confess to not always being a huge Elizabeth Gilbert fan. I’ve never read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/eat-pray-love/&quot;&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/a&gt;. I liked &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/books/the-signature-of-all-things/&quot;&gt;The Signature of All Things&lt;/a&gt;, but didn’t love it. But I did love her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius?language=en&quot;&gt;TED talk about creativity&lt;/a&gt; and, after listening to the first two episodes of this talk, I did go out and buy a copy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elizabethgilbert.com/&quot;&gt;Big Magic&lt;/a&gt;, her latest book about creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The podcast is well done and she covered a lot of issues that I’ve found myself dealing with lately with regards to my writing. A lot of what she and her guests said had me thinking about what I do and how I do it (and why I do it) in new ways and got me all excited about writing again. I’ve been in a rough place lately, both inspiration and discipline have been severely lacking, and although I love the book I’m working on, to be honest the writing has been a bit of a slog. I’ve actually been avoiding it a lot lately. But after today, I’m actually excited to get back to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quotes — Zen Minds, Beginners Mind</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I love this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the “Introduction,” by Richard Baker, to Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind, by Shunryu Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Zen way of calligraphy is to write in the most straightforward, simple way is if you were a beginner, not trying to make something skillful or beautiful, but simply writing with full attention as if you were discovering what you were writing for the first time; then your full nature will be in your writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
