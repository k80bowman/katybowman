            <p class="articles--quote">On average, nine readers cull through the approximately 3,000 per year fiction submissions looking for the thirty or so that will ultimately end up on the pages of The Antioch Review. These readers do a close reading of the submitted stories, find the ones they like, and send them on to editor, Robert Fogarty, who makes the final decision. The Antioch Review is grateful for all its first readers and thought you might like an inside look at how just one of them, Katy Bowman, approaches this important task.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Re-reading books can be like visiting an old friend you haven’t seen in years. Sometimes you pick up the conversation like you’d never lost touch. Other times you share awkward silences while trying to think of an excuse to leave early.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Ms. Short’s book is full of hard-won lessons. “The biggest turns in life come when you’re paying the least attention,” MayJune, a character in the novel, tells Donna, “making small choices you don’t yet know will change everything.” And, indeed, this novel is very much about the choices we make in our lives and how we must work hard to make sure those choices move us closer to our dreams.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">When I was a kid, we took a lot of road trips. That meant spending several hours in a car—sometimes the entire day—which added up to a lot of boredom. Especially for me, since I get motion sickness and basically can’t do much while a car is moving except look out the window. Reading was definitely out of the question.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Heroes, Villains, and Vincent, written by Trenton Payne and illustrated by Shahab Shamshirsaz, is a picture book about the decision everyone has to make sooner or later about the kind of person they want to be. Poor Vincent, he has it harder than most. He loves having two families, but each one wants him to be something completely different. Super hero or super villain? How is a boy to choose?</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Ms. Grossman’s humor and down-to-earth approach to parenting and life are entertaining and refreshing. In a world that is increasingly bent on “perfection,” she encourages us all to slow down and enjoy the beauty and mishegas of daily life with children</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">A few years back I picked up the first book in Jacqueline Winspear’s Maisie Dobbs mystery series because I liked the picture on the cover. I needed a book that would carry me away and it looked like it would do the trick. A simple image of a woman from the 1920s in a cloche hat? Perfect. And I was not disappointed.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">In the last few months, my daughter has become enthralled by the stories of Beatrix Potter. Just writing that sentence makes me happy. I loved Potter’s stories when I was younger. My favorite was always The Tale of Benjamin Bunny. The funny thing is, I can’t remember why. I think maybe because he got into trouble. Which makes me laugh, because it is the exact same reason my daughter has fallen in love with the books, too.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">I have to say, I was proud of my son when we took him to see The Hobbit a couple of months ago. “That wasn’t in the book,” he said several times during the movie. My husband had read him the book a few months before, and he is only five, so the fact that he remembered so much detail was impressive. I don’t know that I could remember that much detail about what happened to me the day before, let alone what happened in a book I read six months ago. Clearly, it had made an impression.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Rise of the Guardians is based on the Guardians of Childhood series of books by William Joyce. In the movie and the books Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman, and other familiar childhood icons become guardians of the children of Earth, bringing them joy and protecting them from Pitch, the nightmare king. The movie tells the story of Jack Frost and his transformation from a mischievous spirit into a guardian and, in the process, finding his center–the meaning of his life.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Kate DiCamillo, Alison McGhee, and Tony Fucile have created two characters that from the first page of Bink and Gollie secured a place in my heart. The two books (so far, I am hoping for more)—Bink and Gollie and Bink And Gollie, Two for One–celebrate the friendship of these two girls and send them off on adventures: roller skating, having a “compromise bonanza,” taking a goldfish to the movies, an unfortunate encounter with the whack-a-duck man at the state fair, and finding their destiny, among others.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">I don’t know about you all, but I usually have at least three books going at one time, if not more. It makes for a pretty frenetic reading schedule, but there are so many books out there I can’t wait to start reading, and so I don’t. However, sometimes I just want to be immersed in the story and be able to experience it from beginning to end in a couple of hours. This is what makes book-to-movie adaptations so great.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">Before I had even met my husband, I was buying books for our kids. Our future kids, I should say—they wouldn’t be born for another eight years. But I was twenty, working in a bookstore, and there they were, treasures from my childhood. Aw heck, who am I kidding? I bought them for myself.</p>

            <p class="articles--quote">The summer I turned 19, after my first year of college, I took off, leaving behind my small midwestern campus, to work in a gift shop in Yosemite National Park. That’s a whole other story, and maybe someday I’ll tell it, but for now it’s enough to know that I was there. And that one night, some friends and I decided to take a trip to San Francisco on our day off.</p>
